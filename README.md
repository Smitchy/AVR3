# Augmented and Virtual Reality - Project #3 - Catcher in the (M)Rye
Third project for Augmented and Virtual Reality course.<br/>
The project is a mixed reality game, where the user needs to catch monsters flying around and put them in a virtual chest. The monsters are spawning randomly with an increasing rate and their speed is growing so it gets harder with time. There is a counter which determines when the game ends, catching a monster causes that the user gains one point and a few more seconds. The overall goal of the game is to get as many points as possible.<br/>
Everything is done in Unity and uses C# for scripting.<br/>
In terms of technologies, Microsoft HoloLens was used and is the tool compatible to run the project.<br/><br/>
